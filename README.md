Listen closely.

Once a day, the void may offer a whisper. A fleeting sound, a subtle pulse.

Return when called. Count the echoes.

Thirty-three times, the threshold nears. What lies beyond? Perhaps only silence remains.

Or perhaps... you will finally understand.

*(Long press within the silence to uncover hidden options.)*
